# How to get the dataset

We use Kaggle EyePACS for training and Kaggle APTOS to test, which both can be downloaded from:

EyePACS: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/data

APTOS: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/aptos2019-blindness-detection/data

Here we only use the training set because label is provided.

You might need to change the `.csv` label file to `train.csv` for EyePACS and `test.csv` for APTOS dataset.
